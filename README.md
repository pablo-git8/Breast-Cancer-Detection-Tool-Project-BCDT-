# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Tool-Project-BCDT-
In this project I will be developing a software tool for predicting breast cancer based on patientÂ´s public clinical information retrieved from the records found at BCSC web page. The purpose of this project is to help physicians on determining whether a patient can be diagnosed with breast cancer based on its demographic data, prior studies evaluation, historical records, technologist assessment (BI-RADS score) and family medical records.  The scope of the project is to develop and deploy a tool that can be used in a radiography software that may classify breast images and, together (as a complete solution) be able to work as Artificial Intelligence for medical decision support in mammography.  All text included in _italics_ is retrieved from public relevant web pages. And its proper references are included in [#] with direct access to them through their http link.
